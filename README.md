## 🧪 Overview

This study investigates how pressure affects the structural and dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature using **Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD)** simulations.  
The deep neural network models are trained on **SCAN-based density functional theory (DFT)** data.

> **Model applicability:** Room temperature (330 K), pressure range: **0.1 MPa to 1000 MPa**
