## Overview

We investigate how pressure influences the structural and dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature using Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) simulations. Our models are trained on density functional theory (DFT) data using the SCAN exchange-correlation functional.

The study reveals a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant with pressure, driven by increased density and modified hydrogen-bond networks, alongside weakened dipolar correlations.

Model suitable for: Room temperature，1bar～10kbar
